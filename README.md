Sales Dashboard
KEY INSIGHTS

December witnessed the highest sales at 24,984, marking a remarkable 157.33% increase compared to the lowest sales in January, recorded at 9,709.

Additionally, visual representations highlighted the AAA battery as the product with the highest quantity ordered, while Wired Headphones received the least orders.

The top 5 products with the highest sales counts were iPhone, 27in 4k Gaming Monitor, Google Phone, MacBook Pro laptop, and Thinkpad laptop, with the MacBook Pro laptop being the most expensive.

Leveraging the map visually, I showcased the top 5 cities contributing to the highest sales in the United States, namely San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and Atlanta.

This project underscores my adeptness in manipulating and extracting insights from extensive datasets, enabling data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

Conclusion:
Creating a sales performance analysis dashboard using Power BI in Excel is a powerful way to gain actionable insights into your sales data. By following these steps, you can build an interactive and informative dashboard that empowers decision-makers to make data-driven decisions and drive business growth.
